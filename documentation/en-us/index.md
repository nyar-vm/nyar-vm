## What is Valkyrie?

Valkyrie is a modern functional programming language designed for building reliable, high-performance applications. It combines an algebraic effects system with a strong type system to provide a brand-new programming experience for developers.

### Core Features

- **Algebraic Effects**: Gracefully handle side effects, unifying exceptions, asynchrony, and state management.
- **Strong Type System**: Compile-time error checking with support for type inference and pattern matching.
- **Multi-target Compilation**: Compiles to WebAssembly, JavaScript, and native code.
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data, higher-order functions, and tail-call optimization.
- **Modern Syntax**: Concise and expressive syntax design.
- **Progressive Adoption**: Seamless integration with existing ecosystems.

### Quick Example

```valkyrie
// Define algebraic effects
effect Http {
    get(url: String): String
    post(url: String, body: String): String
}

// Function using effects
micro fetch_user_data(id: Int) -> User {
    let response = raise Http.get(`/api/users/${id}`)
    parse_json(response)
}

// Effect handler
micro main() {
    handle fetch_user_data(42) with Http {
        get(url) -> resume(http_client.get(url)),
        post(url, body) -> resume(http_client.post(url, body))
    }
}

// Pattern matching and type safety
match user_result {
    Some(u) if u.age >= 18: print("Adult user: ${u.name}"),
    Some(u): print("Minor user: ${u.name}"),
    None: print("User does not exist")
}
```

This simple Valkyrie program demonstrates:
- Definition and usage of algebraic effects
- Strong type system and type inference
- Pattern matching and conditional guards
- String interpolation and modern syntax
